# Wind Turbine Blade Damage Detection

A deep learning–based system for automated detection of structural damage in wind turbine blades using YOLOv8 segmentation. The system analyzes blade images to identify defects such as erosion, contamination, laminate damage, and other surface anomalies, and delivers results through an interactive Streamlit web interface.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [wind-turbine-damage-detection.streamlit.app](https://wind-turbine-damage-detection.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- YOLOv8 segmentation for precise defect localization
- Automated structural inspection report generation
- Interactive web interface for image upload and analysis
- Visualization of detection results and damage metrics
- CSV and PDF inspection report export
